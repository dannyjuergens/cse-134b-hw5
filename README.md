 Issues:
 [x] form.reset() not working.
 [ ] currentUser is showing undefined when logging in so I'm writing to the undefined database. Maybe it's an issue since I'm running it localhost. Will look into it when I have time.
 [ ] when I click upload image on the form it doesn't prompt me to select an image. So right now I didn't create an image tag to go along with the rest of the info that is displayed to user.
